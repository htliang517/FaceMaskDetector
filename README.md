# Face Mask Detector

This is a machine learning project with YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN along with pytorch.

The goal of this project is to train a model that can classify people in a frame into three types: 

1. People wearing mask correctly
2. People wearing mask incorrectly
3. People not wearing mask



Main packages Used in this project are:

- Faster R-CNN: [Faster R-CNN â€” Torchvision documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/faster_rcnn)
- YOLOv5: [YOLOv5 Official GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle Dataset - Face Mask Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection/data)
